# 📊 Data Distribution Analysis

This section of my Data Analytics Learning Journey focuses on exploring how data behaves, spreads, and reveals hidden patterns through visual storytelling and statistical understanding.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Analyze and visualize the distribution of key numerical and categorical features to understand:
- Skewness  
- Variation  
- Outliers  
- Pattern concentration  
- Category balance  

This foundational step strengthens data intuition and improves preprocessing decisions for future models.

## 📈 Techniques Used

### 🔹 Histograms  
To see how values cluster and how often they occur.

### 🔹 Boxplots  
To detect spread, symmetry, and outliers effectively.

### 🔹 KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) Plots  
To understand smooth probability distributions.

### 🔹 Pairplots  
To observe multi-feature interactions and patterns.
